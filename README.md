This is a web application to control multi-color lights. This home page categorizes lights into groups such as "Living Room", "Guest Bathroom", etc. Users can use the interface to control lights by either toggling them on (white light), off, or setting a custom color. 

The lights in this project are RGB LEDs attached to Arduino (NodeMCU with ESP8266) to demonstrate proof-of-concept. Future build-outs could include modifying the application to control more robust light systems such as Philipps Hue.
